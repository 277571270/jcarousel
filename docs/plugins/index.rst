Plugins
=======

By default, the jCarousel core only contains the minimum functionality needed to
built carousel widgets. Specialized features are provided through plugins.
This prevents a bloated core with everything built in and lets you pick only the
features you really need.

jCarousel comes with the following plugins:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   control/index
   pagination/index
   autoscroll/index
